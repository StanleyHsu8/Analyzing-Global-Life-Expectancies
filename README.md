****Global Life Expectancy Data Analysis
****Overview

This project explores the relationship between life expectancy and several socioeconomic and health-related factors across 183 countries from 2000 to 2015. The dataset was sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) via Kaggle, and includes variables such as GDP per capita, alcohol consumption, immunizations, healthcare expenditure, and years of schooling.

The core question guiding this analysis is:

How should countries allocate their resources to best serve their citizens' health and prosperity?

The goal is to uncover patterns that can inform policymakers, researchers, and activists in improving global health outcomes.

Dataset Description

Source: Kaggle - Life Expectancy (WHO)

Years Covered: 2000–2015

Countries: 183 (after filtering for missing data)

Observations: 2,939 rows

Variables: 22 including:

Life expectancy

GDP per capita

Health expenditure

Immunization rates

Alcohol consumption

BMI

Schooling

Status (developing vs developed)


Research Questions

What is the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy in 2015?

How have changes in healthcare expenditure correlated with changes in life expectancy from 2000 to 2014?

Is there a significant relationship between years of schooling and life expectancy in 2015?


Methods

Python libraries used: pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels

Statistical analysis:

Linear regression

R² values to evaluate correlation strength

Visualizations:

Color-coded scatter plots (developed vs. developing countries)

Comparative change analysis across time

Custom functions created to:

Clean and organize country-level data

Compute percentage change across years

Visualize variable relationships


Key Findings
1️⃣ GDP vs Life Expectancy

R² = 0.201 → Weak correlation

High-income countries had higher life expectancy, but low-GDP countries varied widely, suggesting other key influencing factors.

2️⃣ Healthcare Expenditure Change vs Life Expectancy Change

Low direct correlation found

Even with massive increases in spending, some countries showed minimal improvement in life expectancy.

Highlights the importance of effective allocation of resources rather than sheer spending.

3️⃣ Schooling vs Life Expectancy

R² = 0.67 → Strong correlation

Especially evident in developing countries; increased education often linked with improved health outcomes.


Limitations & Future Work

Omitted variable bias: Not all key influencers (e.g., political stability, healthcare quality) were captured.

Data age: Latest data is from 2015; excludes major events like COVID-19.

Next steps:

Expand analysis with newer datasets

Break down "healthcare expenditure" into more detailed components

Explore machine learning models for improved prediction
